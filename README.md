# stlc-subtyping
Introduced subtyping into Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC), allowing for more flexible type assignments following Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle. We implemented an algorithmically driven type system supporting subtyping, and then expanded it with joins and meets, based on TaPL by Pierce. Final project for COMP 523 @ McGill University
